### Information problem you're trying to solve: 
We wanted to create a social platform for users of Spotify because there is a lack of a way to share music easily with friends on Spotify. We felt the sharing of music to the public or friends should be in the same app rather than using other apps for that purpose.
### Identified stakeholders/target browsers: 
The stakeholders would be spotify, as this could help drive up their user numbers, and music lovers who use the app, allowing them to interact with each other easier.
### Data you chose to work with: 
We worked with the Genius API because it was easier to access and providen most of the information that we wouldve used from the spotify API. We collected song information like titles, artists, and albulm cover art.
### Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem: 
A problem that we ran into was accessing the specific information we needed from the spotify API. The solution to this problem was switching over to the genius API
### Technical system decision rationale: we chose to use:
* Sequelize because it allowed us to map the song and user objects to a SQL database schema. 
* Bootstrap because the frameworks allowed us to create a sleek, modern application.
* Ajax because it allows for real time updates without the whole webpage to reload
### How/if your final system helps to address the problem: 
Yes, our final system helps to address the problem. Our information problem is that Spotify has unsuccessfully tried to implement a social media aspect to their application. However, most people find that it is confusing and hard to share music they enjoy. So we solved this problem by creating a space where it is easy for our audience to share their music taste and interact with others.
### Challenges faced and impact on final design: 
Some challenges that we faced were switching to the genius API from the spotify API. This led to a lack of certain information that we intended on including into or final design. We wanted to include album names, but as a replacement, we used album cover art and that added a visual aspect to our design.
### Possible future work directions with this problem: 
a list of future work directions are as follows:
* Create a graph data structure to connect friends
* Add a chat feature to comment on others postâ€™s
* Introduce new song releases
* Soundcloud does do a similar process, creating direct competition
* An alternative solution would be to work with soundcloud and reshape their application
